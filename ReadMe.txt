This solution contrains simplied version of K-d tree to find nearest n neigbhours given a query point P.

Variable parametes in code to moify:
1.locationRange : Range of x and y : Example 10 (for x and y from -10 to 10)
2.inputDataLength : Length of given Input Data (In algorithm shared, currently its generated randonly)
3.numberOfClosestNeighbours : number of n closest points to find in Algorithm
4.priceRange : Price Range of event tickets
5.query : random time query point P. Example: City(51,74,999,null); //x:51,y:74,999 is random location Id of Query Point
